# Scenario:
An auctioneer, in his auction shop, accepts a bid from bidders. The auctioneer calls for a price for a product. When a bidder accepts a bid, he or she raises a numbered paddle which identifies the bidder. The bid price then changes and all the other bidders must be notified of the change. The auctioneer then broadcasts the new bid to the bidders. Code the above scenario using Observer and Singleton pattern.

# Singleton Pattern:
Java Singleton Pattern is one of the Gangs of Four Design patterns and comes in the Creational Design Pattern category. From the definition, it seems to be a very simple design pattern but when it comes to implementation, it comes with a lot of implementation concerns. The implementation of Java Singleton pattern has always been a controversial topic among developers. Here we will learn about Singleton design pattern principles, different ways to implement Singleton design pattern and some of the best practices for itâ€™s usage.

# Observer Pattern:
The observer pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
The object which is being watched is called the subject. The objects which are watching the state changes are called observers or listeners
